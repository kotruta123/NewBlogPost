## Introduction
In this final blog post, I'll reflect on the last feature I worked on, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned during the development process. Additionally, I'll share a video showcasing the final product.

## Feature 1: Gamepad Key Controls

### Implementation:
I added key bindings to the respective buttons on the gamepad to allow for interaction within the game. The goal was to make the game fully playable using a gamepad, providing a more immersive experience by used for playing at VIA Arcade Machine.

### Bug and Solution:
I encountered significant issues when trying to integrate gamepad controls. Initially, I attempted to add another input manager, but only two buttons functioned correctly. After that, I included a package from the Itslearning lesson, but this too failed to resolve the problem. Then i remade id from the beginning by following the tutorials on the YouTube and it worked.

## Reflection on the Development Process

### Challenges Faced:
During development, I faced numerous bugs and challenges, particularly with Unity's UI system. The interface often did not behave as expected, especially when dealing with small elements. Attaching scripts to game objects within the project's hierarchy proved difficult at times, and debugging was a time-consuming process. I lost a lot of valuable time trying to resolve these issues.

Another major challenge was related to the WebGL build format. Throughout 99% of the development process, the project was set to this platform, but I couldn't achieve the desired results. After spending four days trying to fix these issues without success. I remade the project by initially using a platform WebGl with some minor changes provided by unity and it worked. I could build it successfully and run it in the browser.

### Final Thoughts:
Despite the difficulties, I'm proud of the project I've created. Although not everything went as planned, I managed to implement almost all the essential mechanics I envisioned. This journey taught me a great deal about game development, problem-solving, and the importance of flexibility in the face of challenges.

## Conclusion
This project has been a significant learning experience. Although there were numerous hurdles, the knowledge gained and the satisfaction of seeing a finished product make it all worthwhile. I look forward to applying these lessons to future projects and continuing to improve as a developer.

Thank you for following along on this journey!
