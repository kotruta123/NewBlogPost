For now was decided that the ball will be a Rigidbody element which will collide with other elements in the game. When the ball touches the cube, box collider of the cubes are on trigger, because they will disappear all the time when the ball touches it.

### Main Mechanics

I multiplied the value of the movement by a particular positive number to make the ball go faster. I used the InputSystem package in Unity to take the inputs from a keyboard and transfer the movement onto the ball. To increase the visual appeal of the game, I rotated the collectables I created on the spot. I modified the PlayerScript file such that, upon collision between the ball with the cubes, they must disappear and increase the total score.
